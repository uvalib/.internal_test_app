RELEASE NOTES

Version 0.10.0
----------------------

- Added the latest OTS jar file with Codec changes and additional Video MIME type inclusion.
- Removed a conflict for DROID with some XML files.
- Removed some TODO and TBD defaults in Video byteOrder and compression.
- Removed default of video scanType for 'apcn'.
- Added MediaInfo video "standard" for FITS and Ebucore broadcastStandard.
- FITS-129 - Bug fix - Identity section of output does not properly remove tool identifying less specific file and mime type.

Version 0.9.0
----------------------

Video - Normalized height and width values in FITS default output.
Update of the following tools used by FITS:
DROID 6.1.5
ExifTool 10.00
Tika 1.10
NLNZ Metadata Extractor 3.6GA
JHOVE 1.11
m2ts files now included in MediaInfo tool and excluded from Exiftool tool.
Revised licensing details of MediaInfo 3rd party libraries.

Major refactoring of how JAR files are handled by the tools that are Java-based. JAR files specific to each tool are loaded
within their own custom class loader. Details are in edu.harvard.hul.ois.fits.tools.ToolBelt.java.

Version 0.8.10 (10/21/15)
----------------------
NOTE:
This is the first official release of Video support using the MediaInfo tool.

Out of the box, the FITS MediaInfo tool will ONLY be supporting the following 64-bit OSes:

    Windows 7 - 64-bit
    Mac OS X -  64-bit
    Red Hat 6.x - 64-bit
	
These come preconfigured for MediaInfo release 0.7.75.

For more information about the MediaInfo tool, please see:

    https://mediaarea.net

It is important to know that you MUST use a 64-bit JVM (JDK or JRE) to use the MediaInfo
tool as it is distributed in FITS.

The FITS MediaInfo tool will detect whether the OS is Windows/Mac OS X/LINUX and dynamically
load the associated MediaInfo libraries for any of these OSes.

If you wish to use a LINUX distribution other than Red Hat 6.x, or for more trouble-shooting details,
please see:

    http://projects.iq.harvard.edu/fits/faq
