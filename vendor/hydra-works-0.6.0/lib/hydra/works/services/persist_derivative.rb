    ##
    # Persists a derivative to a FileSet
    # This Service conforms to the signature of `Hydra::Derivatives::PersistOutputFileService`.
    # The purpose of this Service is for use as an alternative to the default Hydra::Derivatives::PersistOutputFileService.  It's necessary because the default behavior in Hydra::Derivatives assumes that you're using LDP Basic Containment. Hydra::Works::FileSets use IndirectContainment.  This Service handles that case.
    # This service will always update existing and does not do versioning of persisted files.
    #
    # @param [#read] stream the derivative filestream
    # @param [Hash] directives
    # @option directives [FileSet] :object the FileSet object to attach to
    # @option directives [Symbol] :label the type of derivative
    # extract file type symbol (e.g. :thumbnail) from Hydra::Derivatives created destination_name
