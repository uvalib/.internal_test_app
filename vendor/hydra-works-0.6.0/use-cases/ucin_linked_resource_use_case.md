Cincinnati Linked Resource Use Case
Sponsor: @scherztc

Given an intellectual work (object) with external resources (LinkedResource)  
  As a repository comprised of Collset -> Wortem -> Compart -> GenericFile / LinkedResource
I want to maintain the relationships between descriptive and provenance 
  metadata about each object.
And I want to maintain sorting, label, and other metadata, as well as files
    that represent the whole object in one place
So that I can have multiple Compart of a Wortem tied to one instance of a model 
    with each Compart containing a GenericFile or LinkedResource.
Therefore I can have a Wortem that does not contain a GenericFile, but only LinkedResources.

Here are some example object we need to represent, and their characteristics, from least to most complex.

LinkedResource
Compart
Wortem
Collset
