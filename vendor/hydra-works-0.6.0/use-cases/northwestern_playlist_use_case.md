Northwestern Playlist Use Case
Sponsor: @julesies

Given a User Collection with an intellectual grouping of items 
As a primary list used by individual users to create groups of items or favorites. 
I want to maintain the following relationships of a Nested User Collection.  
  A bookmark-like approach to grouping items
  A User Collection can be shared with others in some way or kept private
  Items within User Collections are not governed by the collection in any way
  Items can belong to more than one User Collection
  Items in a repository do not have to belong to any User Collection
  Items can appear in the same User Collection more than once 
  Ordered items 
So that a Researcher who creates a group of intellectually related items for a research purpose. Example:
Professor who creates a group of items for a particular course or presentation. Examples: Art History professor creates an group of images for a lecture. A history professor creates a playlist of audio and video for an entire course. 
Audio and Video playlists.

Here are some example object we need to represent, and their characteristics, from least to most complex.
