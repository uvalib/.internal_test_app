#### Goal and Reason
Given an event (a conference), with many sub-events with many creative works created by many entities about related but different topics: 

As a user:
* I want to see a hierarchical list of all sub-events that can sorted by date, title, or creator while maintaining the order of any sub-components (for example, parts 1-3 of a single music performance are kept together and in order).
* I want to see a timeline of events with dates and times, so that there is greater context for the event. 
* I want to see descriptive metadata for the entire event (the conference).
* I want to see descriptive metadata for each sub-event (for example, a musical demonstration as part of a presentation).
* I want to see technical metadata for each file (let's say an .mp3).
* I want to see components by descriptive characteristics, so that I could for example access all the performances of electronic percussion music.
